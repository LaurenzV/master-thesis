2D rendering is omnipresent in our digital lives: Whether it be your web browser displaying a web page or your email software showing you the contents of an email, they all rely on 2D rendering to be able to present their contents on a screen. While there already are many existing solutions for 2D rendering, the question of which fundamental rendering technique is the "best" so far still has no clear answer. Because of this, we propose a new rendering paradigm that is based on so-called _sparse strips_, a memory-efficient run-length encoded intermediate representation of a rendered vector path that can be consumed in multiple ways, for example for further rasterization or caching. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we implement a CPU-based 2D renderer that fully embraces this paradigm and supports the most common operations expected of a 2D renderer. We also show that the renderer is very amenable to SIMD optimizations and multi-threading, allowing it to make the best use of modern-day CPUs. As part of an evaluation, we determine that the renderer achieves very good performance overall and outperforms many of the existing CPU-based renderers in most benchmarks.
