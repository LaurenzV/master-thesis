2D rendering is omnipresent in our digital lives: Whether it be your web browser displaying a web page or your email software showing you the contents of an email, they all rely on 2D rendering to be able to present their contents on your screen. While there already exist a range of solutions for 2D rendering for both GPU and CPU, the question of which fundamental rendering technique is the "best" so far still has no clear answer. In the pursuit of contributing to this research question, we propose a new rendering paradigm that is based on so-called _sparse strips_, a memory-efficient run-length encoded intermediate representation of a rendered vector path that can be consumed in multiple ways, for example for subsequent rasterization or caching. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we implement a CPU-based 2D renderer that fully embraces the paradigm and supports the most common operations expected of a 2D renderer. We also show that the renderer is very amenable to SIMD optimizations and multi-threading, allowing it fully utilize the capabilities of modern CPUs. As part of an evaluation, we determine that the renderer achieves compelling performance and outperforms many of the existing CPU-based renderers in a wide range benchmarks, validating our thesis that the sparse strips approach is promising and could serve as the foundational architecture for the next generation of 2D renderers.
