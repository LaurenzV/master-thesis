First, I would like to acknowledge the team behind Typst for creating a really powerful typesetting system that made the creation of this write-up a breeze and a very enjoyable experience.

Next, I would like to thank Professor Jung for giving me the opportunity to turn the project idea I had into a fully-fledged master's thesis and for guiding me throughout the whole process.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude towards all members in the Linebender community that I have been able to collaborate with in these past few months and who supported me during the whole journey. In particular, I want to thank Raph Levien for his excellent research in 2D rendering that made this project possible in the first place, and for being willing to mentor and support me during this project.
