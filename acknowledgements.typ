First, I would like to acknowledge the team behind Typst for creating their really powerful typesetting system that made the creation of this write-up much more enjoyable and a breeze.

Next, I would like to thank Professor Jung for giving me the opportunity to actually turn this project idea I had into a full master's thesis and guiding me throughout the whole process.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude towards all members in the Linebender community that I have been able to collaborate with in these past few months and who supported me in this whole journey. In particular, I want to thank Raph Levien for this excellent research in 2D rendering that made this project possible in the first place, and for being willing to mentor and support me during this thesis.
